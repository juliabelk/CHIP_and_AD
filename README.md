# CHIP_and_AD

This repository includes
- snATAC-seq metadata tables for ArchR project which includes cells for our samples, blood reference data (Satpathy 2019), and brain reference data (Corces 2020). Note that the table has been split in 3 due to file size limitations but can be merged with rbind().
- Code related to mutant microglia calculations with output plots.

Our code to cluster snATAC-seq data has been previously made available and can be found at https://github.com/juliabelk/brioschi_2023 or https://github.com/juliabelk/mol_cell_2022. Please see https://www.archrproject.com/bookdown/ for current snATAC-seq data analysis best practices and additional details about the clustering procedure.
